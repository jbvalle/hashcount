 A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors -- recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates. In this sense, neural networks refer -- systems of neurons, either organic or artificial in nature.

Neural networks can adapt -- changing input; so the network generates the best possible result without needing -- redesign the output criteria. The concept of neural networks, which has its roots in artificial intelligence, is swiftly gaining popularity in the development of trading systems.
