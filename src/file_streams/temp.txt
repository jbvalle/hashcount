 A neural network is a series -- algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set -- data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates. In this sense, neural networks refer to systems -- neurons, either organic or artificial in nature.

Neural networks can adapt to changing input; so the network generates the best possible result without needing to redesign the output criteria. The concept -- neural networks, which has its roots in artificial intelligence, is swiftly gaining popularity in the development -- trading systems.
