Basically the exact same movie as House of --- Vincent Prices first genuine
horror hit released the previous year but seriously who cares because ---
Mad Magician offers just as many ----- thrills delightful ------ setpieces
joyous 3D effects ------- acting ------------ --- macabre horror gimmicks
as its predecessor! Never change a winning team is exactly what writer Crane
Wilbur must have thought when he penned down Prices character Don Gallico
another tormented soul besieged by fate --- out for --------- against those
who ------- him. Don Gallico is about to perform his very first own
illusionist ---- as Gallico the Great --- plans to ------- the greatest magic
trick in history -------- --- Girl --- the Buzz Saw. -------- promising
solo ------ is abruptly ruined before it even ------ when his previous
employer Ross Ormond appears on stage --- ------ a contract under his nose
stating that all of -------- inventions are the -------- property of the
company. --- sleazy --- relentless Ormond who by the --- also ransacked
-------- once beloved wife takes off with the buzz saw trick --- programs
it in the ---- of -------- rival --- Great Rinaldi.
Inevitably Gallico snaps --- sadistically butchers Ormond but also
being a master of creating disguises recreates his victims ----- ---
even starts leading a double life. --- Mad Magician is an amusing ---
thoroughly unpretentious 50s horror movie in Gr--- Guignol style with a
whole lot of improbably plot twists  the l---lady turns out a brilliant
crime novelist?  --- a h---ful of fantastically grotesque grossout moments
although they obviously remain suggestive for most part . --- 3D delights
near the beginning of the film like a yoyo player --- a goofy trick with
water fountains ------ just serve as timefiller --- contemporary 50s hype
but its still fun to watch even now --- without the means to properly behold
them. --- Mad Magician is also interesting from a ------ical ------- point
of view as the ------ take place around the time fingerprints were starting
to get used as evidence material --- the character of Alice Prentiss is an
obvious reference ------- famous crime authors of that era. Needless to state
that Vincent Price remains the absolute most --------- element of triumph
in ---- film as well as from nearly every other horror movie ---- ---------
man ever starred in. Like no other actor could ever accomplish Price
------- the tormented protagonist who --------- descends further --- further
into mental madness in such an indescribably mesmerizing ---. --- pity Don
Gallico yet at the same time you ---- him enormously. --- ------- his vile
acts of retaliation --- yet simultaneously you realize his murderous rampage
must end in death. Vincent Price simply was a genius actor --- in my
humble opinion the ---------- of the horror genre.
