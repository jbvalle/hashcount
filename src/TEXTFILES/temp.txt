 Multi-Layered Perceptron

In a multi-layered perceptron (MLP), perceptrons are arranged in interconnected layers. The input layer collects input patterns. The output layer has classifications or output signals -- which input patterns may map. For instance, the patterns may comprise a list of quantities for technical indica--rs about a security; potential outputs could be “buy,” “hold” or “sell.”

Hidden layers fine-tune the input weightings until the neural network’s margin of error is ------l. It is hypothesized that hidden layers extrapolate salient features in the input data that have predictive power regarding the outputs. This describes feature extraction, which accomplishes a utility similar -- statistical techniques such as principal component analysis.
Application of Neural Networks

Neural networks are broadly used, with applications for financial operations, enterprise planning, trading, business analytics, and product maintenance. Neural networks have also gained widespread adoption in business applications such as forecasting and marketing research solutions, fraud detection, and risk assessment.

A neural network evaluates price data and unearths opportunities for making trade decisions based on the data analysis. The networks can ----------- subtle nonlinear interdependencies and patterns other methods of technical analysis ------. According -- research, the accuracy of neural networks in making price -------ions for s--cks differs. Some models ------- the correct s--ck prices 50 -- 60 percent of the ----, while others are accurate in -- percent of all instances. Some have posited that a 10 percent improvement in efficiency is all an inves--r can ask for from a neural network.
