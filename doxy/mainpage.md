<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<strong>1 Part: (SOLVED)<br /></strong>
* Open a text file and read the text row by row.<br />
* Separate words by these characters (" ", ".", "\n")<br />
* Store the values in a hashtable using dynamic linked lists.<br />
* Use the sum of character values as value to be hashed. E.g. Cat = (67+97+116) % 23<br />
* Words shall be stored in dynamically allocated memory<br />
* Print out the hash in a readable way. E.g. max 10 words per row.<br />

<strong>2 Part: (SOLVED)<br /></strong>
* The occurrence of words shall be counted instead of multiple entries in the list. <br />
* Add additional word separators:<br />
-  semicolon (;) <br />
-  colon (:)<br />
-  comma (,)<br />
-  question mark (?)<br />
-  tab (\t)<br />


<strong>3 Part: (UNSOLVED)<br /></strong>
* The lists shall always retain alphabetic order.

<strong>4 Part: (SOLVED)<br /></strong>
* Give the user a choice to select one bucket to output separately.
* Print out the entries in the Bucket.
* Let the user select one or more buckets and remove all words from the text which do not match to these selected buckets and write it to a new text file.

<strong>5 Part: (SOLVED)<br /></strong>
* Let the user select one or more buckets and censor all words from the text which match to these selected buckets and write it to a new text file.
* All word separators shall be copied to the new file in the correct places.

<strong>6 Part: (SOLVED)<br /></strong>
* Store the hash in a binary file
* Read and populate the hash from a file and append/count new words into it when the user wants to do this.

<strong>7 Part: (SOLVED)<br /></strong>
* The program arguments are handled by getopt(3).

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

* Start by generating Binary file: Follow Installation instruction

### Installation

* Generate Binary File "./hashcount" by executing make in src/
   ```sh
   make
   ```

<hr>

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

* Hashcount is able to generate Hashtable from any file index requested
* If no input text is explicitly mentioned in argument a default text file in TEXTFILES/default.txt is used
* The User is able to choose different options
* Example:
   ```sh
   ./hashcount -f input.txt -rc
   ```

<table style="width=110%" border="solid black">
    <tr ALIGN=LEFT>
        <th >OPTIONS</th>
        <th>DESCRIPTION</th>
    </tr>
    <tr ALIGN=LEFT>
        <th>-f path_rel_to_bin/filename.txt</th>
        <th>For specifying an input file declare a file name after the -f option i.e. -f input.txt</th>
    </tr>
    <tr ALIGN=LEFT>
        <th>-r</th>
        <th>This removes all keywords from a textfile by a chosen bucket. This requires no arguments.</th>
    </tr>
    <tr ALIGN=LEFT>
        <th>-c</th>
        <th>This censores all words except chosen buckets. This requires no arguments</th>
    </tr>
</table>

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Example

* These examples serve as illustrations how this application could be run
* For inputting indices for removing and censoring words spaces or comma could be used
   ```sh
   ./hashcount -f input.txt -rc
   ```
